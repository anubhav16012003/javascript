JAVA-SCRIPT NOTES:-

* Java-script was invented by Brendon Eich in 1995 and became the ECMA standard in 1997.
* ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard and ECMAScript is the official name of the script.

Q. Where should we put Js in an HTML document?
Ans. Js can be placed inside the <head> or <body> section of the HTML page or in both.
2. Placing the <script> tag at the botton of the body element will improve the display speed because script interpretation slows down the display.

* External Js:- 1. External scripts are practical when same code is used in many different web pages.
2. Js file have the file extension .js
3. To use the External script put the name of the script file inside the src(source) attribute of <script> tag.
example- <script src="myfile.js"> </script>

NOTE:- 1. The script will behave as it is located exactly where the <script> tag is located.
2. You can place external script reference in the <head> or in <body> as you like.
3. External script can not have <script> tags.

Q. What are the advantages of external Js?
Ans. 1. It separates the HTML and code.
2. It makes the HTML and Js easier to read and maintain.
3. Cached Js file can speed up page loads.

* document.write():- It is convenient for testing purpose only.
2. Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all the existing HTML.
3. It can also lead to unexpexted behaviour and make code harder to maintain.

* window.alert():- In Js, the window is an global scope object. It means values, properties and method by deafult belongs to window object.
Hence, it is optional to use window keyword.

Q. When code can run without semicolon then why it is highly recommened?
Ans. It makes statement clearer and prevents side-effect statements that could occur without semi-colon.
Hence it is not required but highly recommened.

* Java-script values:- There are two types of values-
1. Fixed Values (Literals)
2. Variable Values (Variables)

1. Js Literals:- a. Numbers  b. Strings
2. Js Variables:- Variables are used to store data values. Js use keywords var, const & let to declare variables.

* Naming in Js:- a. A letter (A-Z) or (a-z) b. A Dollar sign ($) c. An underscore (_)

* NOTE:- 1. Numbers are not allowed as first character in names. By this way Js can easily distinguish indentifiers from numbers.
3. Hyphens are not allowed in Js, As they are reserved for subtraciton.

* Types of comments:- 
1. Single line comment (Block Comment):- Starts with '//', Block comments are often used for formal document.
2. Multi-line comment:- Starts with '/*' and ends with '*/'.

* var:- 
1. Var keyword was used in Js from 1995 to 2015.
2. It should only be used in code made for old browsers only.

* NOTE:- 'const' and 'let' keyword were added to Js in 2015.

Q. When to use var, const & let?
Ans. 1. Always use const if value should not be changed.
2. Always use const if type should not be changed (object & arrays).
3. Only use let if you can not use const.
4. Only use var if you must suppoert old browser.

* Js Identifiers:- All js identifiers must be identified with unique names. 
These unique names are called identifiers. These are case-sensitive.

* NOTE:- You can not re-declare a variable with let and const.

* let:- 
1. The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
2. Variables defined with let can not be re-declared.
3. Variables defined with let can not be used before declared.
4. Variables defined with let have block scope.

* Block-scope:-
1. Before ES6(2015), Js had Global scope and Functional scope.
2. ES6 inrtoduced two important keywords 'let' and 'var'.
3. These two keywords provide block scope in Js.
4. Variables declared inside block scope can not be accessed from outside the block.
example- {
            let x=2;
          }
            // x can not be accessed here
5. Variable declared with 'var' keyword can not have block scope.
6. Variables declared inside the block scope can be accessed from outside the block.
example- {
            var x=2;
          }
            // x can be accessed here 

let accountPassword = "JodxBilla7417";
let accountName = "anubhavVerma";
let contactNumber = 7417426133;

//now I re-assigning the values
accountPassword = 12345;
accountName = "Anubhav";
contactNumber = 8218726133;

//here instead od using console.log() one by one we can use 
console.table([accountPassword, accountName, contactNumber]);
